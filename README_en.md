## Install Manjaro-i3wm

The first thing to do is go to the [offical website](https://manjaro.org/) to install the newest iso image file.

Enter the "Download" interface, here we choose the "i3" in the "Community" interface.

In addition, we also need a software called "rufus", it can help us load the iso into our USB.
