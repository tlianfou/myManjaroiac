## I3wm
This is the introduction about [i3wm](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/I3)(i3)

If you want to install the i3wm, i wrote a document to teach you(and me) how to install it.

You can go and read the [README_i3.md](./README_i3.md).

## Kde
You may know the `KDE plassma` in some places, if you want to install it, you can find a lot of tutorials online.

Configuration the `KDE plassma` is a very interesting process.

Hurry and try it!

## Vim
[Vim](https://www.vim.org/) is the god of the editor, or perhaps is the `neovim`.

You can go to the folder named `vim` and read the [README.md](./vim/README.md) in that folder.

## Pacman
