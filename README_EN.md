## Install Manjaro-i3wm

The first thing to do is go to the [official website](https://manjaro.org/) to install the newest iso image file.

Enter the "Download" interface, here we choose the "i3" in the "Community" interface.

In addition, we also need a software called "rufus", it can help us load the iso into our USB.

open the "rufus" to load iso, select options by content of the image.

Press `start` and select the `DD mode` in the pop-up window, remember don't to choose the wrong option.

Now, you can reboot your computer and go into bios to set.

1. in the interface of `Security` you must change the `secure boot` to be `enable`
2. in the interface of `boot` you must change the `Boot mode` to be `UEFI Boot Type` and set your USB to be the top priority option to open the computer.

Then reboot your computer and you can start to install your Manjaro-i3wm!
